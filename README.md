This repository contains the source code for a static, multi-section homepage for a fictional creative agency named "Criativo". This project is a front-end exercise built purely with HTML5 and modern CSS3, demonstrating complex layout and styling techniques.

The entire layout is orchestrated using a top-level **CSS Grid** (`.conteaner`), with **Flexbox** employed extensively for component-level alignment, such as in the navigation bar, hero content, and feature boxes.
